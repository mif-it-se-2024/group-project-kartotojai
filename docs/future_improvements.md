# Future Improvements

Our order matching system project has a strong foundation with core functionalities such as order matching, account management and a console-based interaction system. However, there are several improvements that we could implement to further improve our project and add relevant features.

---

#### Integration with Real-Time Data Feeds

Currently the system uses static and predefined stock data. Integrating real-time stock market data via APIs would provide users with up-to-date stock prices and enhance realism.

#### Graphical User Interface

Transitioning from a console-based interface to a graphical user interface would significantly improve user experience. Libraries like PyQt or Tkinter can be used to create a more interactive trading dashboard.

#### Advanced Order Types

Add support for advanced order types:

- **Trailing Stops**

- **Good-Till-Canceled (GTC) Orders**

- **Iceberg Orders**

#### Portfolio Analytics and Visualization

Develop features to help users analyze their portfolio performance with metrics such as return on investment and risk analysis. Integrate data visualization tools for graphical representations of performance trends.

#### Multi-User Environment

Enable simultaneous access for multiple users, either through local sessions or by hosting the application on a server. Incorporate authentication and secure user sessions for better usability in collaborative or competitive settings.

#### Simulation Enhancements

Add realistic simulation features

- **Market Volatility Simulation** 

- **Dividend Payments**

- **News-Based Events Impact**

These additions would make the simulator more comprehensive for training and strategy testing.

#### Mobile and Web Accessibility

Expand the platform to include mobile and web versions using frameworks like Flask (for web apps) or Kivy (for mobile apps).

#### Machine Learning for Trading Strategies

Integrate machine learning models to predict market trends or suggest optimal trading strategies based on historical data.

#### API for Programmatic Access

Provide an API for programmatic access to the system, allowing users to integrate their custom trading bots or algorithms.

#### Integration with Blockchain

Use blockchain technology for secure, immutable records of trades, creating a decentralized and transparent trading environment.

#### Educational Mode

Add an educational mode with tutorials, quizzes, and performance metrics to help beginners learn about stock trading in a guided environment.

#### Localization and Multi-Currency Support

Extend the system to support multiple currencies and localize the interface to different languages for a global audience.

#### Conclusion

These would be our future iplementations for our project if we ever decided to work on it again. It would take us a lot of time to research and learn more in depth about the implementations above, but with the right amount of time and effort we as a team could expand our project further more.
