## Challenges and Solutions in the Order Matching System Project

This document outlines the most important challenges encountered during the development of the Order Matching System and the solutions implemented to address them. 

### 1. Understanding the Project Scope

**Challenge:**

At the start of the project, we did not fully grasp the scope and requirements of the Order Matching System. This initial misunderstanding caused confusion and delays, as the team began working in the wrong direction and eventually had to restart the project with a clearer approach. 

**Solution:**

*Team Discussions:* Effective team meetings were done to revisit and refine the project goals.

*Research:* Each team member took time to research order matching systems and understand the core concepts.


### 2. Delayed Implementations

**Challenge:**

We were late in implementing core features, which caused a delay in upcoming tasks and testing.

**Solution:**

*Reprioritization:* Tasks were reprioritized based on urgency and importance to ensure that critical features were completed first.

*Increased Workload:* We worked together to complete delayed tasks faster, ensuring that we completed the project on time.


### 3. Flexible Milestone Management

**Challenge:**

Following the milestones strictly in sequential order proved to be inefficient. Some milestones were more relevant to implement at different times than originally planned.

**Solution:**

*Milestone Adjustment:* Our team was flexible in completing milestones, focusing on the most critical features at the time.

*Weekly Meetings:* Weekly discussions with professor helped with alignment on what tasks needed immediate attention, even if they didn't follow the initial milestone order.

### 4. Late Testing

**Challenge:**

Testing was delayed, which made it harder to identify and fix bugs in earlier stages of development.

**Solution:**

*Milestone Testing:* We created a test for each of our milestones to check whether the implementation had no issues.

*Test Improvements:* Weekly discussions with professor gave us insights on how the tests should look like, thus we improved them accordingly.

### Lessons Learned

*Start with a Clear Scope:* Taking the time to understand the project at the beginning avoids confusion and inefficiency later.

*Adaptability Is Key:* Flexibility in following milestones allowed the team to address the most critical issues at the right time.

*Prioritize Testing Early:* Incorporating tests early ensures that bugs are caught sooner, saving time and effort in later stages.

*Effective Communication Matters:* Discussions and collaborative problem-solving were essential to overcoming obstacles.
