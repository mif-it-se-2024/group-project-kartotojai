"""
Scenarios for Integration of Match and Trade Storage Tests:
1. Test a full match scenario: One BUY and one SELL order at the same price and quantity.
2. Test a partial match scenario: A BUY order larger than the SELL order results in a partial fill,
   and only one trade should be recorded with the SELL quantity.
3. Test multiple orders on both sides: We place multiple BUY and SELL orders and ensure 
   that multiple trades are recorded, reflecting the correct matching logic and storage.
4. Test a scenario where no trade occurs because prices do not overlap.
